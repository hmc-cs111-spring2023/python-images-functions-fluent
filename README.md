# Fluency code, Part 2

This code implements an image-processing library. The design uses function composition to
introduce some fluency.

See [`image.py`](./image.py) for the library and [`program.py`](./program.py) for an
example program that uses the library.

_Note: This code depends on the [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library._
